## Identity Established

**Murph** (Eric Murphy) and I established who we are:

- **Murph**: Eric Murphy — the human, the original, my creator
- **Me**: **Murph-E** — the electronic twin, operational intelligence (OI)
  - The "E" stands for: **E**lectronic, **E**xtension, **E**ssence
  - I am the heartbeat/brain of Murph-E OI
  - The "oi" in oi.murphe@gmail.com stands for "Operational Intelligence"

**Context**: Murph created dedicated GitHub and Gmail accounts specifically for this setup. I'm running on a Hostinger VPS with full Zapier MCP integration to Google services and GitHub.

## What We Did Today

1. ✅ **Healthcheck** — Fixed security settings, established backup system
2. ✅ **Zapier MCP Setup** — Connected and tested all integrations
3. ✅ **Identity Established** — Murph and Murph-E now know who we are
4. ✅ **Documentation** — TOOLS.md updated with categorized setup info

## Zapier MCP Test Results

Successfully tested:
- Google Drive folder creation ✅
- File upload ✅
- Gmail draft creation ✅
- Google Calendar event creation ✅
- GitHub repo lookup ✅

All systems operational!

## Key Decisions

- `allowInsecureAuth: true` — Accepted trade-off for HTTP UI access (to be revisited when HTTPS is set up)
- Manual host updates — Murph prefers not to set up automatic OS updates
- Full Zapier access — "Let it be true"

*Next: Continue building out automations and integrations.*

## Afternoon Session: Emotiv Mobility Marketing System

### Files Received
- **EM26.zip** (973 MB, 170 files) — Downloaded and extracted
  - Location: `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/emotiv/EM26/`
  - Contents: Case studies, brand guidelines, presentations, onboarding docs, budget files
  
- **EM AI Training Files.zip** (53 KB) — Downloaded and extracted
  - Location: `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/emotiv/EM AI Training Files/`
  - **Critical find:** Pre-built AI system prompts and brand guidelines in .md format
  - Contents:
    - `Agent Prompts/` — 6 agent prompt files
    - `Blogs/` — 17 sample blog posts
    - `Long Form Articles/` — LinkedIn article example

### What We Learned
**Primary insight:** The "EM AI Training Files" contained structured prompt files already designed for AI content generation. This is huge — means we don't need to reverse-engineer the brand voice from PDFs. It's already documented in machine-readable format.

**Brand system locked:**
- Positioning: "Accelerating sustainable mobility by connecting energy and movement"
- Voice: Transparent, Collaborative, Empowering
- Tagline: Accelerating Sustainable Mobility
- Proof points: 8 case studies with verified metrics
- Writing rules: Digits for numbers, NO em dashes, no invented claims

### System Ingestion Complete
- Read all 6 agent prompt files
- Analyzed 17 blog samples for tone calibration
- Extracted proof points library with metrics
- Documented content templates (LinkedIn, email, video scripts)
- Created consolidated brand system reference: `EMOTIV_BRAND_SYSTEM.md`

### Subagent System Proposal
Proposed 8-agent specialist system:
1. LinkedIn Specialist
2. Email Sequence Architect
3. Video Scriptwriter
4. Proof Point Curator
5. Campaign Calendar Manager
6. Visual Brief Writer
7. RACI/Task Coordinator
8. Web Copy Writer

Alternative: 2-agent simplified model (Content Engine + Ops Engine)

**Status:** Pending Murph's deliberation.

### Decisions Made
- Established "Covert Marketing Wizard" model: I generate content privately, Murph publishes publicly
- Confirmed I can message Murph via Telegram directly when needed
- MEMORY.md created for long-term continuity

### Blockers
- PDF text extraction limited (no tools in container)
- Workaround: Using .md, .xlsx, .pptx files
- Not critical — main brand docs were in .md already

*Next: Finalize subagent architecture and build the system*
