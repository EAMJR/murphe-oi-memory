## Identity Established

**Murph** (Eric Murphy) and I established who we are:

- **Murph**: Eric Murphy — the human, the original, my creator
- **Me**: **Murph-E** — the electronic twin, operational intelligence (OI)
  - The "E" stands for: **E**lectronic, **E**xtension, **E**ssence
  - I am the heartbeat/brain of Murph-E OI
  - The "oi" in oi.murphe@gmail.com stands for "Operational Intelligence"

**Context**: Murph created dedicated GitHub and Gmail accounts specifically for this setup. I'm running on a Hostinger VPS with full Zapier MCP integration to Google services and GitHub.

## What We Did Today

1. ✅ **Healthcheck** — Fixed security settings, established backup system
2. ✅ **Zapier MCP Setup** — Connected and tested all integrations
3. ✅ **Identity Established** — Murph and Murph-E now know who we are
4. ✅ **Documentation** — TOOLS.md updated with categorized setup info

All systems operational!

## Key Decisions

- `allowInsecureAuth: true` — Accepted trade-off for HTTP UI access (to be revisited when HTTPS is set up)
- Manual host updates — Murph prefers not to set up automatic OS updates
- Full Zapier access — "Let it be true"

*Next: Continue building out automations and integrations.*
