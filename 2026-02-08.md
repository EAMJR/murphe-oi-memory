# 2026-02-08 - Five-Tier Architecture Complete

## Major Accomplishment

Completed documentation and implementation planning for **5-tier AI architecture** for Murphe OI.

## What Was Built

### Architecture Design (Complete)
| Tier | Model | Cost | Role |
|------|-------|------|------|
| Kimi | Kimi K2.5 | **$0** | Front door, 90% of tasks |
| Haiku | Claude Haiku 4.5 | $0.017 | Mechanical tasks |
| Codex | OpenAI Codex | $0.001 | ALL coding |
| Sonnet | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $0.03 | Research, analysis |
| Opus | Claude Opus 4.5 | $0.089 | Manager, complex decisions |

## Documentation Created

### In `/projects/murphe-oi/`:
1. **architecture.md** - Complete 5-tier specification
2. **tier-strategy.md** - Decision matrix for tier selection
3. **routing-logic.md** - Decision trees and implementation code
4. **decisions/2026-02-08/model-tier-architecture.md** - Decision log

### Updated:
- **SOUL.md** - Already had 5-tier identity
- **README.md** - Already indexed new docs

## Cost Projection

| Before (Opus-only) | After (5-tier) | Savings |
|--------------------|----------------|---------|
| ~$150/month | ~$15-20/month | **87%** |

## Key Principles Documented

1. **Kimi first** - Free tier handles 90%
2. **Script-first** - If deterministic, use script (free)
3. **Silent success** - Scripts output nothing on success
4. **Escalate smartly** - Only to paid models when confidence low
5. **Isolated sessions** - Scheduled work stays clean

## Routing Pattern

```
User → Kimi (free)
    ↓
    ├── Simple? → Handle ($0)
    ├── Mechanical? → Haiku ($0.017)
    ├── Needs Opus? → Opus decides
    │       ├── Code → Codex ($0.001)
    │       ├── Research → Sonnet ($0.03)
    │       └── Manage → Opus ($0.089)
    └── Format → Kimi formats output
```
