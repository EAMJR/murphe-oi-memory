# 2026-02-13 - OpenAI Skills Upgrade Implementation

## Context
Read OpenAI blog post: "Shell + Skills + Compaction: Tips for long-running agents that do real work" (Feb 2025). OpenAI formalized patterns we were already using.

## Phase 1: Skill Description Upgrades (7 skills)
Updated descriptions with "When to use vs. When NOT to use" decision boundaries per OpenAI best practices:

| Skill | Key Improvements |
|-------|----------------|
| healthcheck | Added: security audits, risk posture, scheduled checks. NOT: troubleshooting bugs, network issues, data recovery |
| openai-image-gen | Added: batch generation, galleries. NOT: single precise image, brand-matching |
| skill-creator | Added: reusable workflows, domain expertise. NOT: one-off tasks, simple native API calls |
| github | Added: PR/CI status, cross-repo work. NOT: simple git ops, unauthenticated |
| openai-whisper-api | Added: cloud transcription, diarization. NOT: local/offline, real-time streaming |

## Phase 2: Reference File Splitting (2 skills)
Reduced SKILL.md context load by moving details to references/:

| Skill | Before | After | References Created |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| healthcheck | ~246 lines | ~140 lines | os-hardening.md, backup-strategies.md |
| skill-creator | ~370 lines | ~125 lines | progressive-disclosure.md, skill-design-patterns.md, packaging-guide.md |

**Context savings**: ~350 lines (~5k tokens) loaded only when needed.

## Files Modified
`/app/skills/healthcheck/SKILL.md` - Condensed, linked to references
`/app/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` - Condensed, linked to references
`/app/skills/healthcheck/references/os-hardening.md` - New (OS-specific commands)
`/app/skills/healthcheck/references/backup-strategies.md` - New (cron/memory docs)
`/app/skills/skill-creator/references/progressive-disclosure.md` - New
`/app/skills/skill-creator/references/skill-design-patterns.md` - New
`/app/skills/skill-creator/references/packaging-guide.md` - New

## Takeaways from OpenAI Post
1. Skill descriptions = routing logic, NOT marketing copy
2. Negative examples reduce misfires (Glean saw 20% drop → recovery after adding)
3. Templates in skills = loaded only when skill triggers (our approach validated)
4. Progressive disclosure: Metadata → SKILL.md → References (3-tier loading)
5. Phase 3+ pending: Domain secrets, sub-agent + skills integration, compaction optimization

## Next Steps
- Phase 3: Domain secrets integration (verify API key handling)
- Phase 4: Sub-agent + skills integration (cron with skill restrictions)
- Phase 5: Compaction optimization (proactive compaction before long tasks)
