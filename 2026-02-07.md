# 2026-02-07 - Second Coach Project Completed

## Major Accomplishment: MVP Execution Package Ready

Completed full Second Coach project documentation and code structure. This is a business MVP for AI-powered performance intelligence for professional athletes.

### Project Overview
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/EAMJR/second-coach (private)
- **Status:** Execution-ready (not yet executed)
- **Total Files:** 25
- **Architecture:** Python Hub (FastAPI + Postgres) + OpenClaw Client Agents

### Business Model
**Flipped Phases:**
- Phase 1: Performance Intelligence ($5,000-7,000/month) - ENTRY POINT
- Phase 2: Off-Court Concierge (+$3,000-4,000/month) - Optional add-on

### Repository Structure
```
second-coach/
├── README.md (concise) + README-detailed.md (full)
├── EXECUTION-PLAN.md (step-by-step deploy guide)
├── hub/ (Python FastAPI service)
│   ├── main.py (5 API endpoints)
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── init.sql (Postgres schema)
│   └── seed_mock_data.py
├── client-template/ (OpenClaw base)
├── skills/ (Hub query skill)
├── scripts/ (4 shell scripts)
└── docs/ (8 comprehensive docs)
```

### Key Scripts Created
- `mvp-bootstrap.sh` - One command deploy (Phases 1-4)
- `new-client.sh` - Create isolated client environment
- `deploy-skills.sh` - Push skills to specific client
- `hub-health.sh` - Check all services

### Scaling Limits
- Solo operator: 8-12 clients max
- Revenue: $50-70k/month at 10 clients
- Time: 50-55 hours/week
- Constraint: Need sub-agents for parallelization

### One-Command Deploy
When ready, user runs:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EAMJR/second-coach.git
cd second-coach
./scripts/mvp-bootstrap.sh
# Result: Working Hub + Database + Mock Client in 15 minutes
```

### Learnings Applied
- Hub model reduces per-client work (analyze once, query many)
- OpenClaw best at personalization/delivery, not heavy compute
- Sub-agents critical for scaling (without them: 6 client max)
- Private repos for business plans, step-by-step approval for sensitive actions

### Next Step
Execute when ready: Deploy infrastructure, create mock client, test game day workflow.
